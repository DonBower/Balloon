So Her is my quest to use the Adafruit Ultimate GPS which comes in 2 flavors, one is a breakout, https://www.adafruit.com/products/746), and the other is a hat (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2324) <b />
The issue with it working straight up is a: the UART connected to the GPIO is disabled, and b: the default GPIO UART is a mini-UART (i.e. software assisted)
